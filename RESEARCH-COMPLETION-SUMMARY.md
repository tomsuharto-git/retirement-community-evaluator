## CONCLUSION

This research has uncovered an exceptional range of retirement community options in Connecticut, from the extremely rare rental-only CCRC (Avery Heights) to nationally-recognized dementia care (Farmington Station Purple Flag), historic National Register properties (AVIVA), and innovative programming (The McAuley's creative pursuits, Middlewoods' UConn affiliation).

**The standout finding:** Avery Heights' rental-only CCRC model without entrance fees is exceptionally rare and valuable for families who cannot or prefer not to invest $100,000-$500,000 upfront while still wanting full continuum care access.

**The quality leader:** Farmington Station's Purple Flag for Dementia Care™ accreditation as one of the first in the nation, combined with "Most Friendly" and "Best Meals" awards, positions it as the top choice for memory care needs.

**The historic gem:** AVIVA West Hartford's National Register status, Vanderbilt heritage, and AssistedPlus innovation make it unique in the market.
