```
✅ Independent Living
```

**Research:**
```

✅ Restaurant-Style Dining (more specific)
➕ 24-Hour Nursing Care

## Conclusion

The research uncovered **significantly more detailed and accurate information** than currently in the database. Most importantly:

1. **Phone number is wrong** - critical for users trying to contact
2. **Missing 5 of 6 care levels** - users searching for those services won't find Duncaster
3. **Missing 12 unique amenities** - undersells the community's offerings
4. **Generic description** - doesn't convey Duncaster's unique value

**Recommendation: Update immediately with research findings to provide accurate, comprehensive information to users.**
